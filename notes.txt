What is a struct?
- A struct is a collection of possibly different types of data. "An array of many types of data"

Example of a student struct:
    typedef struct{
        char lastName[20];
        char firstName[20];
        char initial;
        int id;
        double gpa;
    }student; //This is the name of the struct

So its like an object from javascript

you want to declare items inside a struct:
    student s1, s2={"jones", "tom", 'c', 456, 3.86}; 
    You can not re-assign it later on in the program. 

Use dot operator to access fields of the instanse of the student struct. You would use the name.field. So,
Example:
    s2.id = 789; //Here I have declared an ID inside my instance s2 of my student struct.
    strcpy(s2.firstName, "lucy");
